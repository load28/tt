//! Typed match analysis — one normalized, typed view of every `match`.
//!
//! The pipeline's other phases each look at a `match` through their own
//! keyhole: sema checks rules over raw patterns, codegen emits shapes,
//! and the engine's language surface asks TypeScript about whatever byte
//! the editor points at. What none of them had was a shared, *typed*
//! description of the match itself — which constructors the scrutinee can
//! be, what each pattern binding's payload type is, what an arm body sees.
//! This module is that description, in the mold of rustc's typed pattern
//! representation (surface pattern → analysis with types attached), sized
//! to tt's contract: ttc does not grow a TypeScript type system, so the
//! types here are the *declared* field types from variant declarations.
//!
//! Layering follows the compiler's existing seams exactly:
//!
//! - This module is a pure pipeline phase like [`crate::probe`] and
//!   [`crate::sema`]: text (plus the same imported-declaration input sema
//!   takes) in, analysis out. No file system, no TypeScript.
//! - The *authoritative* types are still TypeScript's. The engine's
//!   language surface asks the checker first — through the same service
//!   seam every other editor answer travels — and falls back to this
//!   analysis when the checker cannot be asked (an or-pattern binding span
//!   has no emitted counterpart; the toolchain may be absent entirely).
//!   That priority is the module's design contract, not an accident: see
//!   `docs/design/match-analysis.md`.
//! - Exhaustiveness is *computed* here and *reported* by [`crate::sema`]:
//!   the declaration table (local > imported > built-in), the covering
//!   rule, and the tuple product all live in this module, and sema turns
//!   the resulting [`Coverage`] into positioned errors. One rule, one
//!   implementation.
//!
//! The two maps the analysis keeps apart are the point of the model:
//!
//! - **Pattern bindings** ([`PatternBinding`]) — one entry per binding
//!   *occurrence*, keyed by its span. In `A(x) | B(x)` the two `x`
//!   occurrences are two entries with two different payload types.
//! - **Body bindings** ([`BodyBinding`]) — one entry per bound *name*, the
//!   alternatives' types merged (`A`'s payload `| B`'s payload), which is
//!   what the arm body actually sees.
//!
//! Merging these early is exactly the bug this model exists to prevent.
