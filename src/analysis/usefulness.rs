//! Exhaustiveness by usefulness — the algorithm, in tt's terms.
//!
//! This is Maranget's *usefulness* check, the one rustc's pattern analysis
//! is built on: a pattern row `q` is **useful** with respect to a matrix of
//! rows `P` when some value matches `q` and no row of `P`. Two questions
//! tt asks are the same question:
//!
//! - **Exhaustiveness** — is the all-wildcard row useful against the arms?
//!   Every value it finds is a value nothing handles, and the algorithm
//!   hands back that value as a **witness** (`Wrap(inner: Yes)`), not just
//!   the name of a missing case.
//! - **Reachability** — is an arm useful against the arms before it? A row
//!   that is not is dead code.
//!
//! Why this replaced counting tags: the old rule multiplied tag sets, so it
//! could only see one level. An arm carrying a nested pattern had to be
//! treated as covering *nothing* — which rejected genuinely exhaustive
//! matches (`docs/tasks/TASK-103-usefulness-exhaustiveness.md`). The
//! recursion here descends into payloads instead, so a nested pattern
//! covers exactly what it covers.
//!
//! What tt brings that a Rust matrix does not: patterns bind fields **by
//! name and by subset** (`Circle(radius)` and `Circle()` both match every
//! `Circle`). Specialization normalizes that — a constructor's row becomes
//! one column per *declared* field, in declaration order, with a wildcard
//! wherever the pattern said nothing.
//!
//! What ttc still does not know is types. A column whose constructor set
//! cannot be identified is [`ColTy::Opaque`]: only a wildcard covers it,
//! so the answer stays conservative rather than confident and wrong.
