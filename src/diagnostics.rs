//! Structured diagnostics — the compiler's report vocabulary.
//!
//! Every tt-level problem is reported as a [`Diagnostic`]: a stable
//! [`DiagnosticCode`], a [`Severity`], a message, and a byte span in the
//! source. One file can carry many of them — the semantic passes accumulate
//! and keep checking the next independent node instead of stopping at the
//! first violation (`docs/design/compiler-core.md` §8, TASK-117).
//!
//! The code is the diagnostic's identity across every consumer: the CLI,
//! `--server`, the engine and the editor all see the same code for the same
//! rule, and the typed and untyped pipelines share one message renderer
//! ([`non_exhaustive_message`]) so their wording cannot drift apart.
