//! Hints — what tt has to say about a file that is not an error.
//!
//! tt's diagnostics are errors, and only errors: the CLI either compiles a
//! file or reports a position and stops. That is a deliberate part of the
//! error-layer contract (`CLAUDE.md`), and it leaves no room for the one
//! thing the pattern analysis knows but must not reject — an **unreachable
//! arm**. Rust reports it as a lint; making it an error here would reject
//! programs that compile today, and tt has no warning level to put it at.
//!
//! An editor does, though. A hint is not part of the compile answer: it is
//! attached to a range, it never fails a build, and the CLI never prints
//! one. So the arms the usefulness algorithm already computes as dead
//! ([`crate::Coverage::unreachable`], TASK-103) surface here and nowhere
//! else.
//!
//! Like [`super::names`] and [`super::completions`] this is **parse-only**:
//! source in, hints out, no toolchain and no project — so an editor shows
//! them mid-edit and in a workspace with no TypeScript installed.
