//! The engine's language-service surface — editor semantics in tt's terms.
//!
//! Every question here arrives as a position **in an `.tt` source** and is
//! answered in the same coordinates: hover a value inside a `match` arm and
//! the range that comes back is in the file the user is looking at, never
//! in the TypeScript it lowered to. The whole journey — projection, the
//! byte-exact mappings, serving lowered modules to the TypeScript language
//! service, the completion probe for a construct the user has not finished
//! typing — happens inside the engine. A consumer (the VSCode adapter, or
//! anything else) converts these results to its protocol and nothing more.
//!
//! The TypeScript reach is [`crate::typescript::service`] (`tsgo --lsp`),
//! chosen feature by feature because the API server does not carry the
//! language-service surface yet — an implementation detail this module
//! hides completely (see `docs/design/lsp-architecture.md`).
//!
//! Projections here use [`crate::emit_mapped`], not the typed pipeline's
//! projection: a buffer mid-edit must still project (emit-map is
//! infallible), because the moment completion matters most is the moment
//! the buffer does not compile.
