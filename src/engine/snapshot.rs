//! A snapshot — the project at one moment, immutable.
//!
//! Every semantic request runs against a snapshot, so an answer is always
//! about one consistent state of the project: the file set, each file's
//! text, and each file's projection, as they were when the snapshot was
//! taken. A later edit produces a *new* snapshot (see
//! [`super::Project::update`]); it never changes this one. That is how
//! stale-answer bugs are ruled out by structure rather than by care.
