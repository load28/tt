//! The HIR — tt's analysis representation.
//!
//! The AST ([`crate::ast`]) is the *syntax* tree: lossless, byte-faithful,
//! the passthrough contract's carrier. The HIR is the *analysis* tree the
//! compiler core works on (`docs/design/compiler-core.md` §4): sugar is
//! normalized away, every pattern-carrying construct becomes the same
//! [`PatternSite`], names written in patterns become unresolved path nodes
//! (resolution is Phase 2's job), and everything has an index-based
//! identity ([`ids`]) that resolves back to source bytes only through the
//! [`HirSourceMap`].
//!
//! What the HIR deliberately does **not** do:
//!
//! - It does not re-parse passthrough TypeScript. An expression tt only
//!   needs to *point at* (a scrutinee, a guard, a pipeline step's text) is
//!   an [`Expr::OpaqueTs`] span; its type is the checker's answer, asked
//!   through the backend seam.
//! - It does not print TypeScript. Core lowering consumes the HIR together
//!   with semantic facts, and the TypeScript backend consumes that Core IR.
//! - It does not resolve names. A constructor pattern carries an
//!   [`UnresolvedPath`]; `DefId`/`LocalId`/`ScopeId` exist so the source
//!   map's shape is final, and the resolver (Phase 2) fills that space.
//!
//! This surface is exported for language tooling but is **not** a stable
//! API: it moves with the compiler core's phases.
