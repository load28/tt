//! Semantic checks over the AST.
//!
//! Everything the parser deliberately does not do lives here: tt-level rules
//! whose violation is a compile error rather than a passthrough. The checker
//! walks the AST depth-first and **accumulates** every violation as an
//! [`TtError`] with a byte offset and a [`DiagnosticCode`], then reports
//! them in source order — one broken construct does not stop the next
//! independent one from being checked (TASK-117; the recovery boundary is
//! per construct: a match whose names did not resolve keeps its own
//! exhaustiveness question suppressed, nobody else's).
//!
//! Error layering: every rule here is an
//! tt-level rule, reported by ttc itself with an exact position. Nothing is
//! delegated to tsc — in particular exhaustiveness, which this module
//! *reports* but no longer computes: [`crate::analysis`] owns the subject
//! table and the coverage rule, and sema turns its answer into positioned
//! errors after the walk (so a match may precede the enum it matches on).
//! One rule, one implementation — see `docs/design/match-analysis.md` §5.
//!
//! Checks performed:
//! - `enum`: no duplicate case tags; with verification enabled, every field
//!   type parses as a TypeScript type fragment (via [`crate::verify`]).
//! - `match`: the wildcard `_` arm is last; no arm repeats a tag already
//!   covered by an unguarded arm (guarded arms may share tags with each
//!   other); or-pattern alternatives all bind the same (field, name) set.
//! - `match` literal patterns: tag and literal patterns never mix in one
//!   match (their emitted discriminants differ); or-pattern alternatives
//!   are all the same kind of literal; no unguarded arm repeats a literal
//!   *value* another already covers (`200` and `0xc8` are one case).
//!   Whether a literal match is exhaustive is a question about the
//!   scrutinee's TypeScript type and is deliberately left to the
//!   `--types` pipeline ([`crate::literal_matches`]).
//! - `try`: must sit inside a function written in its parse region
//!   ([`crate::flow::in_function_body`], carried on the statement by the
//!   parser) — its emitted `return` needs a user function to exit. That
//!   rules out the module's top level, and the statement regions of tt
//!   constructs (a match arm, a `result` block, a template interpolation)
//!   *except* where the user wrote a function there: a `try` inside an
//!   arrow inside an arm is Rust's `?` inside a closure, and is fine.
//! - let-else: the same flow fact decides placement, except the module's
//!   top level is fine (the lowering emits no `return` of its own; a
//!   `throw`-diverging `else` is valid anywhere) — only tt constructs'
//!   statement regions need a user function around it. And the `else`
//!   block must diverge on every path (`return`/`throw`/`break`/
//!   `continue`; a CFG answer) — otherwise the destructuring after the
//!   block would run with the case unproven.
//! - exhaustiveness: a wildcard-free match whose arm tags all belong to an
//!   enum declared in this file, an imported declaration
//!   ([`crate::Options::extern_enums`], collected by the CLI from direct
//!   relative `.tt` imports), or a built-in enum (`Option`, `Result`; the
//!   analysis' declaration table) — must cover every case of that
//!   enum with unguarded arms (a guard may be false, so guarded arms
//!   identify the enum but cover nothing). A tuple match must cover the
//!   cartesian product of its positions. Same-name shadowing runs
//!   local > imported > built-in. Matches whose tags belong to no known
//!   enum (hand-written unions, unresolved imports) are not checked — ttc
//!   has no type information for them. The whole computation lives in
//!   [`crate::analysis`]; what is here is the reporting.
