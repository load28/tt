/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * host.mjs — the TypeScript 7 native backend's host process.
 *
 * ttc embeds this file (`include_str!`) and runs it with `node`. It is the
 * only place that knows the TypeScript API: it opens ONE real TypeScript
 * project over a layered file system where every `.tt` file appears as the
 * ordinary TypeScript it lowers to, and answers tt's semantic questions
 * against that project's checker.
 *
 * The API comes from the TypeScript the project installed (see
 * `toolchain.rs`): the JS client and the native executable speak an
 * unversioned MessagePack protocol and must come from the same build, so
 * the client is named and it runs the executable shipped beside it.
 *
 * The host is a **session**: one line of JSON in, one line of JSON out, for
 * as long as stdin stays open. The compiler is started once and the project
 * is opened once; a later request only says what changed. That is what makes
 * a watch or an editor viable — reopening a real project per keystroke is
 * not.
 *
 *   open   { apiModule, cwd, tsconfig (nullable) }
 *       →  { ok: true }
 *
 *   ask    { modules: [{ path, text }],   // lowered .tt → virtual .ts
 *            literalChecks: [{ module, start, covered: [...] }],
 *            tagChecks: [{ module, start, covered: [...] }],
 *            symbolChecks: [{ module, start }],
 *            emitDeclarations: boolean }
 *       →  { diagnostics: [{ file, start, end, code, message, mismatch? }],
 *            literalMissing: [{ index, missing }],
 *            tagMissing: [{ index, missing }],
 *            tagMembers: [{ index, tags }],
 *            symbols: [{ index, id, name, builtin }],
 *            declarations: [{ path, text }] }
 *
 * An `ask` may also answer `{ error: "..." }`, which fails that request
 * without ending the session. EOF on stdin ends it.
 *
 * `start`/`end` are UTF-16 code-unit offsets — TypeScript's own coordinate
 * space. Mapping them back to `.tt` byte positions is ttc's job (`mapper`),
 * not this host's.
 *
 * Inside one `ask` the per-position questions are batched by module through
 * the checker's array overloads (`getTypesAtPositions`,
 * `getSymbolsAtPositions`, `getTypeOfSymbol[]`), falling back to one call
 * per question on a client without them — see `batched`. The protocol above
 * and the meaning of every answer are the same either way.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = ran (type errors, if any, are in `diagnostics`),
 * 2 = the TypeScript API could not be loaded, 3 = malformed job,
 * 5 = the resolved TypeScript has no declaration emit API.
