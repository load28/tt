//! The TypeScript semantic backend.
//!
//! tt owns syntax and tt-only semantics; TypeScript owns TypeScript
//! semantics. Every question whose answer is a fact about a TypeScript type
//! — what a literal `match` scrutinee narrows to, what method a `val` path
//! resolves to, whether the emitted module type-checks — is asked here and
//! answered by the real compiler, never guessed by ttc.
//!
//! This is a deliberately small semantic adapter. TypeScript syntax and the
//! whole-program AST used for source-preserving lowering belong to SWC inside
//! ttc (`crate::program_syntax`); generated-module syntax is self-checked at
//! that same boundary (`crate::verify`). Do not route those responsibilities
//! through this backend merely because TypeScript 7 is required by the product
//! toolchain: availability policy says the adapter must exist, while this
//! module boundary says which questions are allowed to cross it.
//!
//! The layering is deliberate:
//!
//! - [`backend::TypeScriptBackend`] is the seam. tt features speak to it in
//!   tt's own terms (queries and answers), never in the compiler's.
//! - [`native`] is the only module that knows how the compiler is reached
//!   (a `tsgo` API server, driven through the host script it was built
//!   with). Its instability is contained here.
//! - [`mapper`] converts between the three coordinate spaces involved:
//!   `.tt` source bytes, emitted TypeScript bytes, and the UTF-16 code-unit
//!   offsets TypeScript itself uses.
//!
//! Who assembles the one project graph both hand-written `.ts` and lowered
//! `.tt` modules live in — and who owns its state across passes — is the
//! engine ([`crate::engine`]): a [`crate::engine::Project`] holds the
//! documents and projections, a [`crate::engine::Snapshot`] freezes them for
//! a pass, and the backend here answers about that snapshot.
