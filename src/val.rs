//! `val` — the binding modifier and its compile-time mutation analysis.
//!
//! `val` marks a binding (a `const`/`let`/`var` declaration or a function
//! parameter) as **read-only through that binding**: ttc rejects every
//! mutation whose access path is rooted at it. It is not deep immutability
//! and not ownership — the same object reached through another, unmarked
//! binding stays mutable, exactly as in TypeScript. Nothing about `val`
//! survives into the output: the parser lifts the keyword out of the byte
//! stream ([`crate::ast::Segment::ValModifier`]) and codegen emits nothing
//! for it, so `val const x = 1;` compiles to `const x = 1;`.
//!
//! Two halves live here:
//!
//! - [`modifier_at`] — the *structural* rule the parser uses to decide
//!   whether a `val` identifier is a modifier at all. It is deliberately
//!   narrow so the passthrough contract holds: the two shapes it accepts
//!   (`val const|let|var` on one line, and `val <binding>` at the start of
//!   a parameter-list entry) cannot occur in valid TypeScript, so no
//!   working TypeScript file changes meaning.
//! - [`check`] — the *semantic* pass. Unlike [`crate::sema`] it works on
//!   the token stream rather than the AST, because the bindings and the
//!   mutations it reasons about live in passthrough TypeScript, which the
//!   AST deliberately keeps as opaque byte ranges. It tracks lexical
//!   scopes (so an inner declaration shadows an outer `val`), resolves the
//!   root identifier of every mutation path, and checks calls whose callee
//!   is a function declared in the same file.
//!
//! - [`probes`] — the *delegated* form. [`check`]'s scope model answers
//!   "which binding is this path rooted at?" itself; that is an
//!   approximation of TypeScript's resolution, and shadowing and
//!   redeclaration are where an approximation quietly differs. So this half
//!   collects the `val` bindings and the mutations **without pairing
//!   them**, and a caller with a checker pairs them by symbol identity
//!   ([`crate::val_probes`], `ttc --check-types`). What counts as a
//!   mutation is still syntax, and still tt's own.
//!
//! What it does *not* do is inference: no effect system, no borrow
//! checker, no analysis of what an arbitrary imported function does with
//! its argument, and no verdict on a method call it cannot resolve to a
//! built-in. Run `ttc help val` for the user-facing limits.
